# Twitter Clone
<p>WORK IN PROGRESS</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a project intended as practice to clone Twitter. It is <b><i>not</i></b> anywhere near as good as Twitter. This project uses EJS, Passport, Mongoose, Express, Bootstrap, etc.</li>
<li>I am using what I learned from this [https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/] Udemy course to practice making websites.</li>
<li>The styling will probably be ugly <i>at best</i>. I struggle with styling the most.</li>
<li>I plan to learn and <i>possibly</i> implement React into this project.</li>
<li>The command I use to run the project is nodemon index.js</li>
</ul>
